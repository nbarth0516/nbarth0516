Hello, my name is Nicholas (Nick) Barth and I am a PhD student at the University of Florida's Department of Astronomy.

My research involves studying the rapid neutron capture process in metal poor star systems,
specifically Ultra-Faint Dwarf Galaxies (UFDs) and Early-Type Elliptical Galaxies (ETGs)
